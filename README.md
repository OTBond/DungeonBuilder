# DungeonBuilder

This project generates a dungeon map similar to the style of The Binding of Isaac, using a 2D array of strings and the pygame library to create the display. 
You can shuffle it to get a new randomly generated map by pressing any key, pressing SPACE will increase the amount of rooms by 1, and pressing Z will decrease the amount of rooms by 1.
